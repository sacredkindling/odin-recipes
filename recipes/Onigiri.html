    <p>Onigiri is the easiest snack to make when you are low on ingredients, it can also be termed as the "cheap sushi" as has been in existence since feudal Japan</p>
   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            2 cups cooked sushi rice
        </li>
        <li>
            1/2 cup water, for moistening hands
        </li>
        <li>
            1/4 teaspoon salt
        </li>
        <li>
            4-6 servings of desired filing: nori, tuna, sesame seeds, furikake
        </li>
        <li>
            3 tablespoon soy sauce
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Moisten both of your hands with water, then put some salt in your hands and rub around thoroughly. Water prevents the rice from sticking to your hands, and the salt will lightly season your rice.</li>
        <li>Place a handful of rice into one slightly cupped hand.</li>
        <li> Make an indentation in the rice and fill with 1-2 teaspoons of filling (the amount of filling will depend on the size of the rice ball). Be careful not to overstuff, or your rice ball will fall apart.</li>
        <li>Gently mold the rice around the filling to cover it.</li>
        <li>Use both hands to shape rice ball into desired shape. (TIP: To form a triangular shape, use your thumb, index and middle finger to firmly squeeze each corner of the rice ball).</li>
        <li> You can have your rice balls plain, wrapped in nori (seaweed) or rolled in seasoning such as sesame seeds. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
